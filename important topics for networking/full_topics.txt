🔹 1️⃣ Networking Fundamentals (Must-Know Core)

These are non-negotiable for cybersecurity.

What is a Network?

Types of Networks: LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN

Client–Server vs Peer-to-Peer

Bandwidth, Latency, Throughput, Jitter

Network Devices:

Hub vs Switch vs Router

Firewall

IDS / IPS

Proxy

Load Balancer

🔹 2️⃣ OSI & TCP/IP Models (VERY IMPORTANT)

Hackers think in layers.

OSI Model (7 Layers)

Physical

Data Link

Network

Transport

Session

Presentation

Application
👉 Attacks mapped to layers (e.g., ARP spoofing = Layer 2)

TCP/IP Model

Network Interface

Internet

Transport

Application
👉 Real-world implementation

🔹 3️⃣ IP Addressing & Subnetting (OSCP Favorite)

This breaks many beginners — conquer it 💪

IPv4 structure

Public vs Private IP

IPv6 basics (important!)

CIDR notation

Subnetting & Supernetting

Network ID, Broadcast IP

NAT (SNAT, DNAT)

APIPA (169.254.x.x)

🔹 4️⃣ Core Protocols (Attack Surface)

Know how they work + how they break.

Transport Layer

TCP vs UDP

3-Way Handshake

TCP Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, URG)

Port numbers & services

Application Layer

HTTP / HTTPS

FTP / SFTP

SMTP / POP3 / IMAP

DNS

DHCP

SNMP

SMB

SSH / Telnet

NTP

🔹 5️⃣ Ports & Services (Recon Goldmine)

Well-known ports (0–1023)

Registered & Dynamic ports

Service banners

Port scanning concepts

Open vs Filtered vs Closed ports

🔹 6️⃣ DNS Deep Dive (Used in Attacks)

DNS record types: A, AAAA, MX, TXT, CNAME, NS

Recursive vs Iterative queries

DNS zone transfer

DNS tunneling

DNS spoofing / poisoning

🔹 7️⃣ Packet & Traffic Analysis (Hacker Vision 👁️)

What is a packet?

Packet structure

Packet sniffing

Promiscuous mode

PCAP files

Network traffic analysis basics

🔹 8️⃣ Network Security Concepts

This is where blue meets red.

Firewalls (Stateful vs Stateless)

IDS vs IPS

DMZ

Network Segmentation

VLANs

VPN (IPSec, SSL VPN)

Zero Trust (basic idea)

🔹 9️⃣ Common Network Attacks (VERY IMPORTANT)

If you don’t know these, you’re blind in cybersecurity.

ARP Spoofing / Poisoning

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

DNS Spoofing

DHCP Starvation

TCP SYN Flood

UDP Flood

ICMP Flood

Packet Sniffing

Session Hijacking

Replay Attacks

🔹 🔟 Web Networking Concepts (For Pentesting)

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

HTTP status codes

Cookies & Sessions

Same-Origin Policy

CORS

HTTPS & SSL/TLS handshake

🔹 1️⃣1️⃣ Wireless Networking (Bonus but Powerful)

Wi-Fi standards (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax)

Encryption: WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3

Handshake

Deauthentication attack (conceptual)

Evil Twin (concept)

🔹 1️⃣2️⃣ Cloud & Modern Networking (Growing Importance)

Virtual Networks

Load Balancers

Security Groups

Network ACLs

Basic container networking (Docker)

🔹 1️⃣3️⃣ Networking Tools (Cybersecurity POV)

You don’t need mastery yet — just awareness:

Packet capture tools

Port scanners

Network mappers

Traffic analyzers
